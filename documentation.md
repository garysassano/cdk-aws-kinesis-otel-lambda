# Lambda Function Response Issue in Browsers

## Problem Description

When accessing the AWS Lambda function endpoint through a browser, we encountered inconsistent behavior:

- **Firefox**: Displayed a JSON parsing error
  ```
  SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
  ```
- **Chrome**: Successfully displayed the raw text response without errors

## Root Cause Analysis

The Lambda function was returning a plain text response but without specifying the Content-Type header. This caused browsers to handle the response differently:

1. **Firefox**: Attempted to parse the response as JSON (since it was viewing the JSON tab) and failed because it was plain text
2. **Chrome**: Was more lenient and simply displayed the raw text without attempting to parse it

### Original Code

```rust
Ok(serde_json::json!({
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": format!("Hello from request {}", request_id),  // Note the trailing comma
}))
```

## Solution

The issue was resolved by explicitly setting the Content-Type header to "text/plain", which tells browsers to treat the response as plain text rather than attempting to parse it as JSON:

### Fixed Code

```rust
Ok(serde_json::json!({
    "statusCode": 200,
    "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "text/plain"
    },
    "body": format!("Hello from request {}", request_id)
}))
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Always Include Content-Type Headers**: Explicitly specify the content type in API responses to ensure consistent behavior across different clients
   
2. **Match Content-Type to Actual Content**: Ensure the Content-Type header accurately reflects the format of the response body

3. **Browser Differences**: Different browsers handle responses without proper headers differently, which can lead to hard-to-debug issues

4. **AWS API Gateway Expectations**: When working with AWS API Gateway and Lambda, including proper headers is essential for consistent client behavior

## Implementation Notes

- If returning plain text from a Lambda function, set the Content-Type to "text/plain"
- If returning JSON, set the Content-Type to "application/json" and ensure the body is properly formatted JSON
- The same fix should be applied to all response paths (success, error, etc.) for consistency

## Testing

After implementing the fix by adding the "text/plain" Content-Type header, both Firefox and Chrome correctly display the response without any parsing errors.
